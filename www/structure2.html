              The Bronze Era was started by <strong>Eugen Sandow</strong>, who
              is known as the "<i>Father of Bodybuilding</i>”, in 1894. Sandow
              had competed as a strongman for some time before that, but in 1894
              he started posing during his shows. This posing was the start of
              bodybuilding itself as it moved the audience’s attention towards
              the body and away from feats of strength.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The Bronze Era</strong> is the least known in bodybuilding
              history as there were few gyms to train in during this time and
              relatively no contests to compete in. Weight training was limited
              to barbells and dumbbells, diets varied but were generally similar
              to that of the strongman which built muscle but also brought fat
              with it, and steroids were decades away from being created. There
              were many theories spread throughout the World as to what made
              muscle grow but none were generally accepted by the bodybuilding
              community. This period was essentially bodybuilding’s Wild West.

              Just as there can be no mistaking the Bronze Era started with
              <strong>Eugen Sandow</strong>, the same can be said of the Silver
              Era and <strong>John Grimek</strong>. Sandow had been a strongman
              before becoming a bodybuilder, and Grimek was a weightlifter
              before becoming a bodybuilder and even competed in the
              <em>1936 Olympics</em> for the US. Grimek’s burst onto the
              bodybuilding scene occurred when he won the AAU Mr. America
              contest in 1940. No one had seen a bodybuilder with the size and
              shape of Grimek before. He would win the AAU Mr. America contest
              again in 1941, causing the AAU to create a rule where a previous
              Mr. America winner could not compete in future contests. Grimek
              would compete from 1940-1949 and never be defeated. To this day,
              he remains the only undefeated bodybuilder to compete in major
              contests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bodybuilding saw a modest rise in popularity during the Silver Era
              as gyms became more common and many contests were staged annually.
              Interest in bodybuilding would accelerate in the late 1950s as
              <strong>Steve Reeves</strong> appeared in movies as
              <em>Hercules</em>, and young boys who admired him started lifting
              weights to achieve his look. Weight training had advanced to
              higher reps to stimulate the muscle for growth instead of
              strength, and the typical workout was performed on the full body.
              Diet saw modest advancements in avoiding processed foods and
              sugar, but during <em>World War II</em>, with rationing in effect,
              bodybuilders ate what they could find. It should be noted that
              after WWII most Americans were underweight, so avoiding fat was
              not as big an issue. Steroids would become available in 1958 with
              the creation of Dianabol by <strong>Dr. John Ziegler</strong>,
              although it is generally accepted that bodybuilders did not start
              taking steroids until the early 1960s. The bodybuilding lifestyle
              was starting to become more defined as tips on exercise and diet
              were spread throughout the various muscle magazines of the day.

              The use of steroids in the early 1960s marked the beginning of the
              Golden Era. Golden Era bodybuilders tested these new drugs on
              themselves throughout the decade, fine-tuning what worked and what
              didn't. Natural bodybuilders soon realized that to keep up, they
              would have to use these drugs or watch bodybuilding competitions
              from the stands. The effects of steroids on health were not known
              at this time, and most of these drugs could be purchased easily
              with a doctor's prescription. Although steroids were used by
              virtually all competitors towards the end of the era,
              bodybuilders’ physiques were still generally symmetrical and
              aesthetic. Many competitors from this era claimed steroids were
              only used for the last month or two before a competition to give
              them a more “polished” look.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Golden Era saw a huge rise in popularity towards its end as
              <em>Pumping Iron</em> was produced and
              <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> began his rise to the top
              of Hollywood with the Conan movies.
              <strong>Frank Zane’s</strong> rise to Mr. Olympia from 1977 to
              1979 was probably the most popular period in bodybuilding ever, as
              his physique was seen as desirable and obtainable by the general
              public. Exercises evolved as Arthur Jones and others created
              machines to isolate muscles in the 1970s, and the split system of
              training only a few muscles with higher sets was adopted over the
              full-body workouts of the Silver Era. Diets changed to a high
              protein, low carb approach that still dominates bodybuilding
              circles today.

            <p>
              The current Mass Era was ushered in by
              <strong>Dorian Yates’</strong> rise to Mr. Olympia in 1992. It was
              clear that Yates was a different kind of bodybuilder than what had
              been seen before. Dorian would continue to get bigger every year
              and would eventually succumb to a bloated waist in his last year
              of competition (1997), which he attributed to insulin usage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Ronnie Coleman</strong> would surpass Yates and become the
              poster child for the Mass Era as no one to this day has passed him
              in size. The Mass Era has and is still being defined by who can
              pack the most muscle on the body. This has led to distended
              stomachs which have finally been negatively judged over the last
              few years. Today, one of the most important aspects of a Mr.
              Olympia winner is keeping their stomach in check.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exercises and intensity have ultimately remained stable since the
              Golden Era, although variations exist. Diet is still primarily
              high protein, low carb, but the quest for size has resulted in
              bodybuilders consuming much more than their Golden Era mentors.
              Steroids are what define this era more than anything else as the
              variations available have skyrocketed since the Golden Era.
              Technology keeps creating more intense steroids which has created
              bigger bodybuilders. Perhaps this era is almost at a close as
              Classic and Physique contests spring up as the public demands a
              return to the more aesthetic bodies of the Golden Era.
